# Gosl &ndash; Go scientific library

Gosl is a computing library written in Go to help with the development of software for scientific
research. The library tries to be as general as possible. The use of concurrency for multi-threaded
applications and message passing for parallel computations are considered. Functions and structures
for geometry calculations, random numbers generation and probability distributions, optimisation
algorithms, and plotting and visualisation are implemented as well.

[See the documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/cpmech/gosl) for more details (e.g. how to call
functions and use structures).
