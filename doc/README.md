# Gosl &ndash; Go scientific library

Gosl is a computing library written in go language (golang) to help with the development of software
for scientific research. The library tries to be as general as possible. The use of concurrency for
multi-threaded applications and message passing for parallel computations are considered. Functions
and structures for geometry calculations, random numbers generation and probability distributions,
optimisation algorithms, and plotting and visualisation are implemented as well.

[See the documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/cpmech/gosl) for more details (e.g. how to call
functions and use structures).

## Key aspects of the library

Here, we call _user-defined_ types as _structures_. These are simply Go `types` defined as `struct`.
Some may think of these _structures_ as _classes_. Gosl has several global functions as well and
tries to avoid complicated constructions.

An allocated structure is called an **object** and functions attached to this object are called
**methods**. The variable holding the pointer to an object is always named **o** in Gosl. This
variable is similar to `self` or `this` in other languages (Python, C++, respectively).

Some objects need to be initialised before use. In this case, functions named `Init` have to be
called (e.g. like `constructors`). Some structures require an explicit call to a function to release
allocated memory. This function is named `Free`. Functions that allocate a pointer to a structure
are prefixed with `New`; for instance: `NewIsoSurf`.

The directories corresponding to each package has a README.md file that should help with
understanding the library more in details. These include links to the definition of all functions
and structures (the developer's documentation, generated by `godoc`).
