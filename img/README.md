# Gosl. img. Image and machine learning algorithms for images

More information is available in **[the documentation of this package](https://godoc.org/github.com/cpmech/gosl/img).**

The `img` subpackage implements functions to manipulate images and perform analyses.

This package also uses [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to perform highly efficient and complex
computations in computer vision and machine learning.
