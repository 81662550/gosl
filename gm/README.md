# Gosl. gm. Geometry algorithms and structures

More information is available in **[the documentation of this package](http://rawgit.com/cpmech/gosl/master/doc/xxgm.html).**

The package `gm` provides some functions to help with the solution of geometry problems or simply to
perform computations with structures at least loosely related with geometry.

Some basic geometry structures and functions are:
1. `Point`, `Segment`
2. `DistPointPoint`, `DistPointLine`
3. `VecDot`, `VecNorm`

Some structures and functions to perform fast searches in the 3D space are:
1. `Bin`, `Bins`, `HashPoint`

The more _advanced_ structures in this package are:
1. `BezierQuad`: quadratic Bezier curve and algorithms
2. `Bspline`: B-spline and algorithms, including fast computation of derivatives
3. `Nurbs`: NURBS and algorithms, of derivatives. NURBS solids are also implemented.
